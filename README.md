# Polaris

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed.

- [Node v14](https://nodejs.org)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.io)
- [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started)

## Development

1. Run `netlify dev` to start the Netlify Dev server. It will open a tab to `http://localhost:8888` but close it.
2. Instead access [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) to access Polaris.
3. Profit!

We're not using Netlify Dev server's `http://localhost:8888` as it doesn't support HTTPS.
