Backend Functions
=================

Unlike the main repo which uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), the backend functions use [PNPM](https://pnpm.js.org) to discover and try out it's potential. Please make sure you have PNPM installed instead of Yarn.

## Requirements

1. Node v12.18.4
2. [NPNPM](https://pnpm.js.org)
